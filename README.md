- 👋 Hi, I’m @Ashmax23, a newer maker with a 3D printer and time to burn.
- 👀 I’m interested in 3D printing, and Arduino projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning C++, HTML, CSS, and Javascript.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on 3D models and C++ programs for arduino.
- 📫 You can reach me at my email: ashmax3d@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: she/her
- ⚡ Fun fact: LCD screens are very hard (pretty easy but it took me a ridiculous amount of time) to learn how to code.
